This link helped me figure out how to set up the last component of this assignment. My button is not appearing where I want it to however. It appears right next to the element, not beneath it.

Parts 2-4 I was able to figure out myself. A lot of times it helps to write down what you are trying to do before coding it. This helped me better understand what needed to happen once the function ran.
